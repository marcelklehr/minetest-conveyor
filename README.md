# Conveyor mod
for [Minetest](http://minetest.net/)

A conveyor (or conveyor belt) can be placed between two nodes for transferring resources from one to the other. This allows you, for instance, to different store ores in a chest, connect that chest with a furnace and have the furnace automatically supplied with smelting materials from the chest. You can also supply the furnace with fuel that way.

Conveyors also work like a charm in combination with the [rubber collector](https://gitorious.org/marktraceur-minetest-mods/rubber_collector) and the factories from the [factories mod](https://gitorious.org/marktraceur-minetest-mods/factories).
